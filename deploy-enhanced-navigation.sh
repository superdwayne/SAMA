git commit -m "feat: Implement enhanced navigation with dynamic repositioning

🚀 Enhanced Navigation Features:
- Smart wrong turn detection (2-3s vs 5-10s before)
- Multiple recalculation strategies with fallbacks
- Real-time navigation quality indicators
- Spatial indexing for better performance
- Enhanced UI with progress tracking and metrics

🎯 User Experience Improvements:
- Direct map access (removed landing modal)
- Fast route recalculation on wrong turns
- Visual feedback for navigation quality
- Wrong turn counter and distance tracking
- Mobile-optimized responsive design

🔧 Technical Enhancements:
- Advanced heading analysis and trend detection
- Consecutive validation to prevent false positives
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Debug information for development
- Backward compatible with existing navigation

📱 Accessibility & Performance:
- Reduced motion support
- Touch-friendly controls
- Dark mode compatibility
- O(n) spatial indexing vs O(n²) calculations
- Smart cooldowns to prevent excessive API calls
