# üöÄ Quick Start: Dynamic Pricing Implementation

## Why You're Seeing the Default Price

You're currently seeing "‚Ç¨4,99" because your components are using static fallback prices. The dynamic pricing system I created isn't fully integrated yet.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

1. **Enhanced API** (`api/get-price.js`) - Can fetch all pricing options from Stripe
2. **Updated Utilities** (`src/utils/pricing.js`) - New functions for dynamic pricing
3. **Updated Components** - Payment and RegionDetailPage now use dynamic pricing
4. **Test Component** - Available at `/dynamic-pricing-test`

## üîß Next Steps to See Dynamic Pricing

### Step 1: Install Stripe Package
```bash
npm install stripe
```

### Step 2: Get Your Product IDs
```bash
# Set your Stripe secret key
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here

# Run the script to get product IDs
node get-product-ids.js
```

### Step 3: Update Product IDs
Copy the output from the script into `src/utils/pricing.js`:

```javascript
export const REGION_PRODUCT_IDS = {
  'centre': 'prod_actual_id_here',
  'center': 'prod_actual_id_here',
  'noord': 'prod_actual_id_here',
  // ... etc (copy from script output)
};
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 5: Test the Dynamic Pricing
Visit: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/dynamic-pricing-test`

## üéØ Expected Results

After completing these steps, you should see:

- **Dynamic prices** from Stripe instead of static ‚Ç¨4,99
- **Default price detection** (prioritizes recurring subscriptions)
- **Multiple pricing options** if you have them in Stripe
- **Proper payment intervals** (e.g., "Every 2 months" instead of "One-time payment")

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still see ‚Ç¨4,99:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify your Stripe API key is correct
3. Make sure product IDs are updated in `pricing.js`
4. Check that your Stripe prices are active

### If API calls fail:
1. Verify Vercel deployment is complete
2. Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Test the API directly: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/get-price?productId=prod_xxx`

## üì± Test the Integration

1. **Visit any region page** (e.g., `/region/centre`)
2. **Check the pricing section** - should show dynamic price
3. **Visit the test page** - `/dynamic-pricing-test`
4. **Check browser console** for detailed logging

## üé® What You'll See

Instead of:
```
‚Ç¨4,99
One-time payment
Lifetime access to all content in this district
```

You'll see:
```
‚Ç¨6,95
Every 2 months
Access to all content in this district
```

## üöÄ Ready to Go Live?

Once you've tested and confirmed it's working:

1. Remove the test route from `App.jsx`
2. Delete the test components
3. Update any remaining static price references
4. Deploy to production

The dynamic pricing system will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Fetch real-time prices from Stripe
- ‚úÖ Display the default price (usually recurring)
- ‚úÖ Show proper payment intervals
- ‚úÖ Fall back gracefully if API fails
- ‚úÖ Work across all regions
